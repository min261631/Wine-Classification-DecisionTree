# Wine-Classification-DecisionTree
This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to classify wine samples from the scikit-learn Wine dataset. The model is trained to predict wine categories based on chemical properties. It includes dataset preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning for optimal depth, visualization of the decision tree, and accuracy evaluation.

Features:
- Uses scikit-learn for dataset handling and model training
- Optimizes max_depth for better accuracy
- Visualizes decision tree structure
- Predicts wine categories with high accuracy
