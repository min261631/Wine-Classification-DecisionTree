# Wine-Classification-DecisionTree
A Decision Tree Classifier for the scikit-learn Wine dataset. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning for optimal depth, visualization of the decision tree, and accuracy evaluation. It predicts wine categories based on chemical properties with high accuracy. 

Features:
Uses scikit-learn for dataset handling and model training
Optimizes max_depth for better accuracy
Visualizes decision tree structure
Predicts wine categories with high accuracy
